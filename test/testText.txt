Top advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump are launching blistering attacks on Justin Trudeau for comments he made at the end of the G7 leaders' summit this weekend, with one going as far as to say the prime minister deserves a "special place in hell."

Speaking Saturday after Trump had departed for Singapore ahead of the much-anticipated North Korea meeting, Trudeau reiterated Canada's stance on the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum: The duties are "insulting," Canada won't be pushed around, and he plans to retaliate with dollar-for-dollar tariffs. 

"There's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door," trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News. 

He blasted Trudeau for having positive conversations with the president during the G7 meetings, then changing his tune in a "stunt press conference." 

Trudeau's comments only included statements he's previously made, the Prime Minister's Office pointed out in a statement, adding that Trudeau had made those remarks privately to Trump as well.
